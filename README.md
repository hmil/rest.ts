Type safety across REST APIs in TypeScript!

## What is this?

Rest.ts lets you write API contracts that tie together consumers and producers within the type system. Out of the box, Rest.ts gives you the following features:
- Auto-completion / intelliSense
- Easy code navigation

*_It would be possible to generate swagger-style API docs from rest.ts definitions, but this feature has not been created yet. Contributors welcome!_

## Guides

If you are just getting started, read the five minutes [**quick start**](https://github.com/hmil/rest.ts/wiki/Quick-Start) guide to get up to speed.
